# Multistrap Helpers

These scripts are intended to create a Debian rootfs from scratch. You can later use it 
for creating an LXC container and later (or immediately, without creating an LXC container) 
create a real installation. 

1. Clone this repo recursively:

    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ceremcem/multistrap-helpers
    ```

1. Create the rootfs:
		
	```console
	root@host:# ./create-rootfs.sh buster.config
	```

    You can use the `./rootfs.buster` as an LXC container rootfs or real installation. 

2. Create a fully bootable distro/installation:

	1. Follow the instructions: [./install-to-disk](./install-to-disk).

# Dependencies

apt-get install multistrap
```
